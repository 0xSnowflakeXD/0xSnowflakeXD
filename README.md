# Programming Experience
A quick details about my skills: Self-trained, highly-experienced, able to detect and patch vulnerabilities/bugs within a second!
## **Self Training Progress**
As you knowing, im start from stratch. First, i heard from a friend on TPT (The Power Toy) in the start days of the game Lua scripting and TPTMP script. Really late then, i knew my friend is programming for a really nice bot named "RBot". Then, i find myself a good solution - JavaScript; The story begins

In the first days, im looking for basic syntax and then arrays, strings, comments, and simple objects, **in a week**

I found it really good, (better than C and C++, as im feeling it in those days)

I started working on simple and early HTML/CSS projects, then a dynamic website with JavaScript finally form

After that, i remind myself my actual goal that im being there: Creating a bot to fight and beat off RBot.
### TModeration Bot story
The begin of the bot. I was really trusted 'kiwi birb', and im really regretted later and start worked indepedentment.
Begins, i started working on the bot core that i "borrow" from RBot, which is really bad i swear. 'kiwi birb' being mean to me all the time and though i cant learn anything for myself. Even though she helped me and not too mean to me, but though, her code is *terrible* and too complex for a simple-ish like me. I have to rollback to my own code because it really work better than her. She tried to crack into smallest vulnerability of both this bot and RyzanX (will be written later).

The bot that i coded (not quite, since the code is from kiwi birb) has been fully rewritten after a long while. Using my 'switch-case' method, like other bots, it bring the best performance and customizability. 'kiwi birb' beg me for so many time to use her method, but now i realize she is trying to lay me down and use things under her decisiion. As she's an Object-oriented-ish and we having opposing point of view, im just needing her help in basic coding, not the bot core or anything related to the bot payload itself.

The bot goes better than i though, classes are just too complex for me. I was really dumb to use her core, at the start...

It was posted on Top.gg since lately 2022. What a good result!

Since 7/9/2023, the bot was permanently suspended due to major technical reason.
## A debugger
Henry133 is a really good debugger and have a big knowledge about errors of programs that he never seen before!
## RyzanX story
Also for competiting off RBot, RyzanX is an experimental feature to offer user a wide range of programming magics. Unlike TModeration Bot, RyzanX does not have any useful feature other than `timeout`, `ban` and `kick` command.

Advance on 'kiwi birb' traditional DeltaCore, here **i don't need any Object-Oriented method but i still can create command with `create()` method.** I don't still understand why RBot use `bot.prefixed()`, the function name is still funny anyways.

RyzanX is continous version of legacy TModeration Bot, with more magics and better things.
# Minecraft Experience
## PvPing Skills
Henry can click up to 8 CPS when he's getting mad or scared. That's too good. With clutching skill and aiming goods, he can beat up anyone in any server.
## Other Skills
Henry can boat-clutching, water-clutching and have lots of skills behind.
# About me: Personal comment
As im feeling about myself, im good enough to team up with other coders/Minecraft players. I have a good teamwork skill so no one can broke my ongoing progress when someone have a crazy decision.
Im a good Minecraft player and a highly-experienced programmer, right?...
