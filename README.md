# Programming Experience
A quick details about my skills: Self-trained, highly-experienced, able to detect and patch vulnerabilities/bugs within a second!
## **Self Training Progress**
As you knowing, im start from stratch. First, i heard from a friend on TPT (The Power Toy) in the start days of the game Lua scripting and TPTMP script. Really late then, i knew my friend is programming for a really nice bot named "RBot". Then, i find myself a good solution - JavaScript; The story begins

I found it really good, (better than C and C++, as im feeling it in those days)

I started working on simple and early HTML/CSS projects, then a dynamic website with JavaScript finally form

After that, i remind myself my actual goal that im being there: Creating a bot to fight and beat off RBot.
### TModeration Bot story
